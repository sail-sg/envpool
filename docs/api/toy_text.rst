========

Most of the environments in classic control borrow from `Gym
<https://github.com/openai/gym/tree/master/gym/envs/toy_text>`_ and
`bsuite <https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite/tree/master/bsuite/environments>`_.

The agent must move a paddle to intercept falling balls. Falling balls only
move downwards on the column they are in.
